        <div class="row mt-3">
            <h4>Function 1: Size & Structure </h4>
        </div>

        <div class="row mt-3">
            <p>
                The design of the autonomous vacuum is easily one of the ideas that began as a million dollar idea with
                a fatal drawback, its inability to do multiple floors. For that reason we decided to set out to build a
                system that has that ability to climb the stairs. As previously discussed, there is a limit to the
                diameter of the autonomous vacuum. The average size of stairs is between 8 ¼” to 9”, forcing us to build
                vertically. This will turn into the reason that the autonomous vacuum will have a taller thinner body.
                Following our requirements now, will force us to build a design that is tall, since we need to take into
                account that the system’s center of gravity is much higher than its predecessors.
            </p>

            <p>
                To make sure that the autonomous vacuum holds as little as possible the majority of the systems designs,
                instructions, and memory is going to be placed inside the docking station. The docking station or the
                command center will be the fundamental piece for controller and communicating wirelessly with the system
                as it moves around the house. This is going to be necessary to keep the system as light as possible, the
                lighter objects will be located at the top of the system. It needs to contain only a bluetooth device
                that can receive instructions and a simple motherboard that has the ability to translate those
                instructions into actions.
            </p>

            <p>
                The battery for the autonomous vacuum will be located at the bottom of the body. This will help the
                system to lower its center of gravity while the wheels and the lifting mechanism will be at the bottom
                of the system along with a set of infrared sensors. The main part of the autonomous vacuum that will be
                at the top is the vacuum hose and vacuum bag. These elements are the lightest parts of the system and
                they will be on top of everything.
            </p>

            <p>
                All the decisions made around the autonomous vacuum design where specifically made to assure that the
                system can deliver a smaller body in width while making room for all the necessary pieces to work
                properly and efficiently.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="row mt-3">
            <h4>Function 2: Lifting Mechanism</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="row mt-3">
            <p>The lifting mechanism for our autonomous vacuum is going to be focused on assuring that the system is
                able to stay vertically. The decision to choose a total of six wheels is more of an insurance policy
                while to some users it might seem kind of excessive. But this is with the whole purpose of keeping the
                mechanism and the system stable. It’s important to say that we want only one wheel to be off of a
                surface at a time, since we need to keep the mechanism balanced. If we refer back to Figure 9, we can
                see that all the wheels are staggered. When the autonomous vacuum arrives at either the beginning or the
                end of the steps it will follow the decision making flow to swivel so that the predetermined ‘front’ of
                the mechanism faces the steps. This will be the best way to ensure that the wheels in our device will
                stay staggered when climbing the stairs.
            </p>

            <p>
                We have also designed that the autonomous vacuum arrives at the bottom of the stairs, all of the wheels
                will activate to lift the entire system at one time. The design also contains the interaction to allow
                the system to go down the stairs while extending all the six wheels to the next step and then lower at
                once. This will help the system to keep the center of gravity low and we have created a design where the
                wheels will fold into the bottom of the system. This will keep the weight of the heavy hardware closest
                to the ground. By having the wheel fold in, it also allows for the wheels to stay close to the ground.
            </p>

        <div class="row mt-3">
            <h4>Function 3: Spinning & Sensors</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="row mt-3">
            <p>Another additional advantage of the autonomous vacuum system is having the six wheels. This will allow
                the system to use the ability to spin around. The spinning system will also help the autonomous vacuum
                by giving the controller options when there is something wrong detected. The battery sensor is essential
                to any type of device and to prevent the autonomous vacuum from getting stuck somewhere in the house and
                allow the manual option for the system to return to its docking station. To ensure that the autonomous
                vacuum stays clean and that there is no dirt contaminating throughout the system, it is essential to
                have a bag sensor. If the system is forced to continue cleaning without room to store the dirt, this
                might cause the overflow into the rest of the machine and break it.
            </p>

            <p>
                That’s why we have chosen to include the infrared sensors on both the center of the system and around
                the bottom of the system. The sensors around the center of the system are essential to detecting the
                ability to climb the stairs. They will also be able to help on detecting when the device is running into
                furniture or running into a wall or corners. The Infrared sensors on the bottom of the system are what
                will help to tell when the autonomous vacuum needs to go down the stairs and prevent it from falling off
                a ledge. This will require a sensor inside of the system that will help to detect if the system begins
                to tilt to much, it will communicate with the controller to help prevent the system from tilting
                further.
