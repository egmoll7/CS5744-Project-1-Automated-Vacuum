                There is no doubt that building an autonomous vacuum with the ability to climb stairs is one of the
                biggest forward thinking areas of work on the robotics field. The movement of human legs is filled with
                muscles that are currently scientists and tech gurus all over the world are trying to replicate. We have
                worked to create a solution that we believe, while being much simpler, can work to climb stairs for a
                simple system. Our goal for this system is to find something that can be built and help to provide some
                insight on the important sensors that we have included. While we have not had the chance to put our
                great idea into practice, we believe that we have accounted for the majority of essential parts.
            </p>

            <p>
                While we have worked to justify the importance of changing the design of the current autonomous vacuum
                system we know that being able to reach all audiences will also express how invaluable it will be to
                have a system that can climb stairs, as not just something that we would like to see, but an
                inevitability for every household in the future.
