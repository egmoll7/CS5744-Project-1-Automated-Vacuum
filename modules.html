                Now that we have the UML chart of the two important steps needed to make the autonomous vacuum into one
                that climbs stairs we can delve deeper into the architecture of the system that we are building and our
                guiding vision. Combining all the individual modules together for our design, we have to follow a basic
                workflow of the decision making of the autonomous vacuum to go up or down the stairs is as follows:

            <p>
                The equipment sensors are going to be the most important part of the system. This sensors are necessary
                for telling the system when it’s safe to function properly. Because we are trying to get a very specific
                system to have the ability to walk up and down the stairs, we need to be sure that all the sensors,
                checks and balances are in place. This will make the system take the decision of not begin to move when
                it can’t move to take in dirt or that it will eventually just stop working properly in the middle of a
                step. It’s important to make sure that the sensors are in place before the controller can move the
                hardware.

                To have the best protection of the autonomous vacuum, we have to make sure that we identify the
                different
                problems the device will have. Identifying those problems will allow us to create sensors with the whole
                purpose of solving them.Because we are working with systems that should react to a previous command and
                not
                independently we have build an interpreter type architecture system for the equipment sensors.
                Interpreters
                are the most common kind of architecture that build virtual machine that close the gap between what the
                engine expects and real world hardware actions. Below we have defined the sensors versus the interpreter
                definitions:

                In Figure 8 we can see that the input is going to be the current state of the autonomous vacuum and any
                changes that may occur. This process is going to be activated as long as the autonomous vacuum is not
                currently trying to climb the stairs, any time that there is a change in any of the defined states of
                the device. The input for the data stored is going to be if the current data doesn’t match when there is
                a change, then it will send a verification for that state. After this, the system will be able to make
                an update to the memory of the state, verifies the current state and that is when it will be
                interpreted. A simulation of what will happen to the system will be done to verify. The simulation will
                use the new information and make a decision and either change direction, stop or head back to the dock
                station.

            The equipment sensors are an important element to tell the system what to do, but we need to know the
            dimensions of the system we are currently using. While it’s important to make sure that the average width of
            the steps are accounted for to where we believe the floor plan is best stored and how it communicates with
            the autonomous vacuum. The actual hardware components for our autonomous vacuum will have the majority

                For this module is required to create a list of the restrictions and requirements to allow the
                autonomous vacuum work properly while implementing a basic functional design. As we can see in Figure 9
                our basic design for what we the autonomous vacuum should look like:
                <ol>
                    <li>The device can’t be bigger than 8”</li>
                    <li>The device must have at least 6 wheels for the best balance</li>
                    <li>The wheels need to be able to go more than one direction</li>
                    <li>The wheels need the capacity to fold for vacuum space</li>
                    <li>The design is specifically important to keep the vacuum level, and not to tilt it</li>
                    <li>The docking base will have displays</li>
                    <li>The device must have infrared sensors on front and sides </li>
                    <li>The vacuum section should be able to swivel</li>
                </ol>

        <div class="row mt-3">
            <p>
                The side view of the hardware (See Figure 9) shows that we are going to need to build something taller
                to make room for the additional components. While the autonomous vacuum will have a small motherboard,
                the majority of the instructions will come from the wireless connection with the docking base. The
                majority of instructions that will be contained in the autonomous vacuum will be to carry the
                information back to the docking base about the change in state. That connection will tell the directions
                where the autonomous vacuum has to go. It’s important to have the focus on a vertical design because of
                the limitation of the average size of stairs. The average size of stairs is between 8 ¼” and 9”. To be
                sure that the design will work in every household, we have limited the diameter to be 8 inches and the
                rest of the components will be implemented vertically.
            </p>

            <p>
                The bottom of the autonomous vacuum (See Figure 9) shows that we have intentionally set the spacing of
                the wheels to be staggered, with a set of infrared sensors all around the body. The importance of the
                staggering is to keep balance when the autonomous vacuum moves up and down the stairs. Because the
                device is going to be heavy, like with a truck there is a larger possibility for the autonomous vacuum
                to topple if it leans forward. To be certain that the autonomous vacuum will stay parallel to the
                ground, the wheels need to stagger while doing the lift to meet the next step, as seen in Figure 10.
            </p>

            <p>
                As we can see in Figure 10 steps c through j the autonomous vacuum will never have more than one leg off
                the ground at a time, assuring to keep good balance. If we see again Figure 10 and follow backwards the
                steps j through a, we can see how the device is able to navigate down the stairs.

            The Controller Module is responsible for the best implementation of the Implicit Invocation Architecture
            System. This module will also make sure that the system for the autonomous vacuum will work properly and
            staying on task. The system should be able to follow a properly design subset of instructions and follow
            them through the process flow of instructions when the autonomous vacuum may be in an unsafe location and it
            decides to leave.

                The controller is where the complex instructions and programs will be contained to communicate with, and
                take instructions from the user. The controller should be able to keep communication between the
                autonomous vacuum while cleaning and navigating the house. This is where the actual software will take
                place and we need to think about how this is going to be built. The controller is the command center and
                the interpreter of all the sensor warnings, See Figure 8. We have laid out the requirements for the
                program that needs to be created:

                <ol>
                    <li>FloorPlanStorage - Program focused on the Floor Plan of the house.</li>
                    <li>DistanceReader - Program with the ability to store the distance that the autonomous vacuum has
                        covered. This will tell the controller module each floor of the house and when the device has
                        reached the steps.</li>
                    <li>CoveredGround - Memory focused on the floor covered from the house. This will allow the
                        autonomous vacuum to to know when to move to the next floor or when to go back to the docking
                        station.</li>
                    <li>BagLevel & BatteryLevelBattery & Bag Sensor Interpreter - The autonomous vacuum will sense the
                        battery or bag levels and the controller will interpret the levels. This will allow the module
                        to notify the autonomous vacuum to come back to the docking station or to continue cleaning and
                        communicate to the user.</li>
                    <li>InfraredReader - Program focused on the ability to interpret what the infrared sensors are
                        reading. This is important to notify the autonomous vacuum about walls and stairs. While the
                        autonomous vacuum will read that there is something in front of it, or there is a ledge, the
                        controller will let the autonomous vacuum know when it is time to lift up to climb or to lower
                        the first leg down.</li>
                    <li>WeightSensor - Program focused on notifying the autonomous vacuum to know when is tie to
                        continue moving and when to stop moving to protect himself.</li>
                    <li>Vacuum - This will contain the regular autonomous vacuum cleaning instructions.</li>
                    <li>Legs - This will allow the autonomous vacuum to lift and lower them.</li>
